### Installation Instructions


To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdwoaSerwah/QuizyPal.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd QuizyPal
   ```

3. **Install docker engine**:
   ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker-ce
    ```

4. **Verify that Docker was installed correctly**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker --version
   ```

5. **Install Docker Compose**
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

6. **Verify Docker Compose is installed**
```bash
docker-compose --version
```

7. **Start Docker after installation**
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

8. **Enable Docker to start on boot**:
   If you want Docker to start automatically when your system boots
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

9. **Set the MySQL credentials in docker-compose.yml file**
   Store the actual credentials in .env to protect sensitive info:

**In docker-compose.yml file:**
environment:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
  MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE}
  MYSQL_USER: ${MYSQL_USER}
  MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}

10. **In .env set the actual values**:
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=database_name # Example: quizypal_db
MYSQL_USER=user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=user_password

***Build the services (app and db) as per the configurations and start the containers for your app and MySQL database.***

**Option 1: you have to use sudo every time**:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

**Option 2: Allows you to run Docker commands without sudo**:

**Add your user to the Docker group:**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

- Then log out and log back in (or restart your terminal session) for the changes to take effect OR
- run this to apply immediately (no logout or restart needed). 
```bash
newgrp docker
```
If you have MySQL installed locally and it's running,
you can stop it to free up the port or use another port.
```bash
sudo systemctl stop mysql
```

**Then run this again**
docker-compose up --build

OR If you want to keep your local MySQL service running and
avoid port conflicts, you can change the MySQL port in the
# docker-compose.yml file.
# For example, change the 3306 port to a different port (e.g., 3307)
# in the db service:

db:
  image: mysql:5.7
  container_name: quizypal_db
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE}
    MYSQL_USER: ${MYSQL_USER}
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
  ports:
    - "3307:3306"  # Change this line to use a different local port (e.g., 3307)
  volumes:
    - quizypal_db_data:/var/lib/mysql

**Then run this again**
````bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**OR build the container**

```bash
   docker-compose build
```

**Then start the container**
```bash
docker-compose up
```

# To start the container and ensure everything is set up (including
# rebuilding images if necessary)
```bash
  docker-compose up
```

# To stop and remove containers, networks, and possibly volumes and
# images. (in case you need to rebuild or something)
docker-compose down

# Temporarily stops the running containers but does not remove/delete them
docker-compose stop

# Starts already created containers that were previously stopped
# without rebuilding or changing anything.
docker-compose start

# Restart the application service
docker-compose restart app

# Verify the Containers are Running
docker ps

**You can access the MySQL database from within the container using**:
```bash
docker exec -it quizypal_db mysql -u root -p
```

**Verify that Redis is working correctly:**
```bash
docker exec -it quizypal_redis redis-cli
```

**Monitor the logs for any errors or issues:**
```bash
docker logs quizypal_app
```

# Enter the Application Container
# Access the running container where your application and its
# dependencies are installed:
```bash
docker exec -it quizypal_app bash
```



## Database Setup

To set up the MySQL database for the Take-A-Bite project, follow these steps:

1. **Install MySQL**: Make sure you have MySQL installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, refer to the [MySQL Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html).

2. **Create the database and user** by running the following command in your terminal:

   You can either run the SQL commands directly or use the setup file:

   - **Option 1: Run the SQL commands directly**:

     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p  # Log into MySQL
     ```

     Then execute the following SQL commands:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS take_a_bite_db;
     CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `take_a_bite_db`.* TO 'your_username'@'localhost';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

   - **Option 2: Use the setup file**:

     If you have a `setup_mysql_dev.sql` file, first, open the file in a text editor and modify the default values for the username and password:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS take_a_bite_db;
     CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `take_a_bite_db`.* TO 'your_username'@'localhost';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

     After making the changes, you can execute the file directly:

     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p < setup_mysql_dev.sql
     ```

    **Or if you need to use sudo:**

     ```bash
     sudo mysql < setup_mysql_dev.sql
     ```

### Database Population

To populate the database with initial data, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Categories Script**:
   Open `categories.sh` and replace the placeholders (`your_username`, `your_password`) with your actual MySQL credentials. Then run the script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x categories.sh
   ./categories.sh

2. **Update the Menu Items Script**:
   Similarly, open menu_items.sh and replace the placeholders with your actual credentials. Before running the script, also replace the category ID placeholders (example, CATEGORY_ID_BREAKFAST) with the actual IDs created in the previous step.

3. **Run the Menu Items Script**:
   After updating the menu_items.sh, run the script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x menu_items.sh
   ./menu_items.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Locations Script**:
   Finally, open locations.sh, update it with your credentials, and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x locations.sh
   ./locations.sh
   ```

Notes
Make sure to replace your_username, your_password, and other placeholders with the actual details you created during the setup process.

Bash Environment: These instructions assume you are using a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, etc.) where bash is available. If you're on Windows, you may need to use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).


## Environment Variables

**Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and populate it with the following variables**:

```plaintext
HBNB_ENV=dev
HBNB_MYSQL_USER=your_username_here
HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=your_password_here
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost
HBNB_MYSQL_DB=take_a_bite_db
HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db
DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqldb://your_username_here:your_password_here@localhost/take_a_bite_db
HBNB_API_HOST=0.0.0.0
HBNB_API_PORT=5005

SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

MAIL_USERNAME=your_email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your_default_email

PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=your_paystack_secret_key
```

**Generate the SECRET_KEY**
To generate a random secret key for your application, run the following command:

```bash
python secret_key.py
```
This will output a secret key that you should copy and paste into your .env file as the value for SECRET_KEY.

**Email Configuration**
Gmailâ€™s SMTP server is what is being used.

Note: If you have two-step verification enabled for your Google account, you will need to generate an App Password to use as the MAIL_PASSWORD.

**Obtain Paystack API Keys**
1. Go to the Paystack website and sign up for an account if you
don't have one. Follow the instructions to obtain your public and secret keys.

2. Replace the placeholder your_paystack_secret_key in the .env file with your actual Paystack secret key.

3. In your static JavaScript file static/scripts/checkout.js, replace the following line with your actual Paystack public key:

```javascript
key: 'pk_test_3172601967078640096a6f10075e6537df112f15',
```

Important: Do not use your Paystack secret key in your client-side code (JavaScript). Only use the public key in the client-side code for security reasons.

Notes
The Paystack public key is safe to use in client-side code. The secret key should remain confidential and only be used in your server-side code (e.g., in API calls to Paystack).

### Run the Application:
Start your application using:
```bash
python3 -m api.v1.app
```

This will start the Flask application, and you can access it in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5005.
