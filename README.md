## Installation
**Note:** These instructions assume you are using a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, etc.) where bash is available. If you're on Windows, you may need to use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdwoaSerwah/QuizyPal.git
   ```

**Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd QuizyPal
   ```

### Environment Variables

**Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and populate it with the following variables**:

```plaintext
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database_name
DATABASE_PORT=3306
DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqlconnector://your_mysql_user:your_mysql_password@your_database_host:3306/your_database_name
DATABASE_TEST_URL=mysql+mysqlconnector://your_mysql_user:your_mysql_password@your_database_host:3306/your_test_database_name

FLASK_APP=api/v1/app.py
FLASK_ENV=development

REDIS_HOST=quizypal_redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_URL=redis://quizypal_redis:6379/0  # Matches the 'redis' service in docker-compose

PYTHONPATH=/app

# STORAGE_TYPE=db
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=5000

SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key

MAIL_USERNAME=your_email_address
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your_email_address
```

#### Generating SECRET_KEY and JWT_SECRET_KEY
To generate a random secret key for your application, run the following command:
```bash
./secret_key_generator.py
```
This will output a secret key that you should copy and paste into your .env file as the value for SECRET_KEY.
Now run the same script again to generate another secret_key for the JWT_SECRET_KEY

#### Email Configuration
Gmailâ€™s SMTP server is what is being used.

**Note:** If you have two-step verification enabled for your Google account, you will need to generate an App Password to use as the MAIL_PASSWORD.


### Docker and docker-compose setup
**Install docker engine**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

**Verify that Docker was installed correctly**:
```bash
sudo docker --version
```

**Install Docker Compose**
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

**Verify Docker Compose is installed**
```bash
docker-compose --version
```

**Start Docker after installation**
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

**Enable Docker to start on boot**:
If you want Docker to start automatically when your system boots
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

**Build the services (app and db) as per the configurations and start the containers for your app and MySQL database.**

**Option 1: you have to use sudo every time**:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

**Option 2: Allows you to run Docker commands without sudo**:

**Add your user to the Docker group:**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Then log out and log back in (or restart your terminal session) for the changes to take effect
*OR*
Run this to apply immediately (no logout or restart needed). 
```bash
newgrp docker
```
**If you have MySQL installed locally and it's running, you can either stop it to free up the port (option 1):**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop mysql
```
**Then run this again**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
*OR*

**If you want to keep your local MySQL service running and avoid port conflicts, you can change the MySQL port in the docker-compose.yml file. For example, change the 3306 port to a different port (e.g., 3307) in the db service:**
```plaintext
db:
  image: mysql:5.7
  container_name: quizypal_db
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE}
    MYSQL_USER: ${MYSQL_USER}
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
  ports:
    - "3307:3306"  # Change this line to use a different local port (e.g. I have changed it from 3306 to 3307)
  volumes:
    - quizypal_db_data:/var/lib/mysql
```

**Then run this again**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Other Useful Commands: ####

**To stop and remove containers, networks, and possibly volumes and images:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

**Temporarily stop the running containers:**
```bash
docker-compose stop
```

**Start already created containers that were previously stopped**
```bash
docker-compose start
```

**Restart the application service:**
```bash
docker-compose restart app
```

**Verify the Containers are Running**
```bash
docker ps
```

**Verify that Redis is working correctly:**
```bash
docker exec -it quizypal_redis redis-cli
```

### Database Setup
The data base will be set up with the docker. The init-scripts/grant_privileges.sh has been added to the docker-compose.yml to grant all privileges to the user created during the docker setup.

**You can run the grant_privileges.sh again if it has not been set up automatically by:**
```bash
./grant_privileges.sh
```

### Database Population
To add data to your database tables follow the steps below.
**Access the running container where your application and its dependencies are installed:**
```bash
docker exec -it quizypal_app bash
```

**Then run the insert_data.py**:
```bash
./insert_data.py
```
**Note:**  You can change or add more to the insert_data.py but make sure at least one user's role is set to "admin" so you can send requests in the admin only routes.

**You can access the MySQL database from within the container using to verify and query the data inserted**:
```bash
docker exec -it quizypal_db mysql -u root -p
```
